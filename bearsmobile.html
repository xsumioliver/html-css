            Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; 
            they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, 
            such as being made to dance. With their powerful physical presence, 
            they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects 
            of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure 
            through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, 
            including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as 
            vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, 
            are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade 
            of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.
